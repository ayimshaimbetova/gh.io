        <h2>Tom and Jerry</h2>
        <p><b>Tom and Jerry</b> is an American animated media franchise and series of comedy short films created 
        in <i>1940</i> by <b>William Hanna and Joseph Barbera</b>. Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by 
        <i>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</i>, the series centers on the rivalry between the titular characters of a 
        cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry. Many shorts also feature several recurring characters.</p>

    <p>In its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 Tom and Jerry shorts for MGM from 1940 to 1958.
        During this time, they won seven Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film, tying for first place 
        with Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies with the most awards in the category. After the MGM cartoon studio
        closed in 1957, MGM revived the series with Gene Deitch directing an additional 13 Tom and Jerry 
        shorts for Rembrandt Films from <i>1961 to 1962</i>. Tom and Jerry then became the highest-grossing animated
        short film series of that time, overtaking Looney Tunes. Chuck Jones then produced another <i>34 shorts</i> 
        with Sib Tower 12 Productions <i>between 1963 and 1967</i>. <i>Five more shorts</i> were produced, The Mansion Cat
        <i>in 2001</i>, <i>The Karate Guard in 2005, A Fundraising Adventure in 2014</i>, and <i>On a Roll and The House 
            That Cat Built in 2021</i>, making a total of 166 shorts.</p>
